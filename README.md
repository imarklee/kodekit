# Kodekit

## What is Kodekit?

Kodekit is a open-source component framework written in PHP. Developed and maintained by [Timble](http://timble.net) 
with the help of passionate developers from all over the world.

Kodekit can be installed through composer helps you to focus on the "business" logic of your components. By doing 
most of the repetitive work for you [boilerplate code][boilerplate] is eliminated which greatly reduces the time to 
develop solutions.

The design pattern based architecture makes your components more flexible: they becomes more **re-usable**,
**replaceable** and more easily **extensible**. Additionally Kodekit provides you with excellent **out-of-the-box
 security** features.

Kodekit uses a [component based architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering)
and includes everything needed to create components according to the [Hierarchical Model-View-Contoller][HMVC]
**(HMVC)** pattern.

## Why Kodekit?

Kodekit is built to help developers create **custom** applications out of pre-build and re-usable components and tries 
to solve following problems:

* Abstract differences between different PHP versions
* Provide a solid modern and lean architecture for building applications.
* Allow applications to be more flexible and extended easily.

## Who is Kodekit for ?

Kodekit is for developers creating custom applications. The framework can only be installed using Composer. If you are 
a developer who wishes to distribute the framework as part of an installable package please 
[contact us](http://www.timble.net/contact/) first.

## Production Ready

Kodekit uses a conservative development approach focused on the lowest common denominator, at time of writing this
is PHP 5.3.

The framework follows the [semantic versioning standard](http://semver.org/). Rest assured : it's designed for stability
and compatibility. We promise that all minor versions will be 100% backwards compatible. Only in major versions backwards
compatibility is not guaranteed.
